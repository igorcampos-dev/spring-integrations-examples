# spring-multimodule-sample

This project demonstrates a basic and simple configuration for a Spring application with a multi-module Maven structure.

## Structure

- `module-a-example`: Example module A with its own code and dependencies.
- `module-b-example`: Example module B with its own code and dependencies.

Each module is managed independently but can share code and dependencies through the parent `pom.xml`.
